# Watch local /tmp/tts-* drop dirs and forward new audio clips to a remote
# host's agent-audio-relay watch dir over SSH. The remote relay then handles
# pad/queue/playback.
#
# Use this on a "sender" host (e.g. a headless Pi running Claude/Codex/etc.)
# when the playback daemon lives on a different machine (e.g. an Android phone
# in Termux running the relay against mpv-tts). It replaces a local
# agent-audio-relay daemon — do not run both, or every clip is delivered
# twice and mpv will restart the file mid-playback.
#
# Env:
#   RELAY_FWD_REMOTE        SSH alias of the playback host (default: p8ar)
#   RELAY_FWD_REMOTE_BASE   Remote watch root, relative to ~ (default: .cache/agent-audio-relay)
#   RELAY_FWD_WATCH_ROOTS   Space-separated drop dirs to watch
#                           (default: /tmp/tts-claude /tmp/tts-codex /tmp/tts-opencode /tmp/tts-ha /tmp/tts-llm)
