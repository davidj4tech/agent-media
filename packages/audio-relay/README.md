# agent-audio-relay

Bidirectional voice interface for coding agents. Hooks capture agent
responses, generate TTS audio, and deliver it to a configurable playback
target. Input sources capture your voice, transcribe it, and route text
to the right agent.

  For split sender/player deploys, swap the relay on the sender for
  agent-audio-relay-forwarder.sh, which scp's clips to the player's
  watch dir and lets the player-side relay handle delivery.
```

## Install

```sh
pip install --user agent-audio-relay
# or from source:
pip install --user /path/to/agent-audio-relay
```

**System dependencies.** The shell-side tools (`tts-ctl`, `tts-popup`,
`tts-status-line`, `aar-mpv-tunnel`, `agent-audio-relay-forwarder`) need
a few binaries on `PATH` that aren't pulled in by pip:

| Tool | Used by | Apt | Dnf | Pacman |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `socat` | tts-ctl/popup/status-line for mpv IPC | `apt install socat` | `dnf install socat` | `pacman -S socat` |
| `jq` | tts-ctl for parsing mpv JSON-IPC replies | `apt install jq` | `dnf install jq` | `pacman -S jq` |
| `inotify-tools` | forwarder watch loop | `apt install inotify-tools` | `dnf install inotify-tools` | `pacman -S inotify-tools` |
| `openssh-client` | tunnel + forwarder | almost certainly already present | as above | as above |

Install all four on every host that's not the playback host. **Without
`socat` on a consumer host, `tts-ctl`/popup will silently no-op against
the local tunnel socket** — IPC requests go out but replies are lost,
and the popup will look like "pause is broken." (We were bitten by this
on AlmaLinux 9, where `socat` isn't installed by default.) Edge-tts /
openai engines additionally need their own runtime: `pip install
edge-tts` and/or an `openai`-equipped Python (e.g.
`pipx install openai`).

### Termux/runit helper

On Android/Termux hosts that use `termux-services`, AAR ships an
idempotent helper for the local playback daemon and `mpv-tts` service:

```sh
# install or refresh runit service files
pkg install termux-services mpv inotify-tools
pip install --user agent-audio-relay
aar-termux-setup install --start

# later: pull latest source, reinstall, and restart services
aar-termux-setup update --repo ~/projects/agent-audio-relay
```

Useful checks:

```sh
aar-termux-setup status
sv status agent-audio-relay mpv-tts
```

The updater is safe to re-run. It performs `git pull --ff-only`,
`python -m pip install --user --upgrade <repo>`, and restarts the runit
services so long-running watchers pick up the newly installed code.

## Deployment topologies

Pick one. Mixing them — running the relay daemon on the sender *and*
the forwarder *and* a relay daemon on the player — sends `loadfile` to
mpv twice per clip, which restarts the file mid-playback and chops the
tail. (Lesson learned the hard way.)

**Single-host.** Hooks, relay daemon, and player all on one machine.
Run `agent-audio-relay` with `RELAY_BACKEND=mpv` (or whatever local
backend), watching `/tmp/tts-*` (or wherever your hooks drop). This is
the simplest setup.

**Two-host (sender + player).** Hooks run on a headless host (e.g. a
Pi running Claude Code) but you want the audio on a different machine
(e.g. an Android phone in Termux running mpv with mpv-tts.sock). The
sender runs `agent-audio-relay-forwarder.sh`, which inotify-watches
its local `/tmp/tts-*` drop dirs for `*.play` markers (see
[Publish protocol](#publish-protocol-play-markers) below) and `scp`s
the audio + marker pair to the player's
`~/.cache/agent-audio-relay/<src_dir>/`. The player runs
`agent-audio-relay` with `RELAY_BACKEND=mpv`, watching that same
directory and archiving played clips into
`~/.local/state/agent-audio-relay/`. Only one daemon ever issues
`loadfile`. This is the recommended setup.

The older alternative — running `agent-audio-relay` on the sender with
`RELAY_BACKEND=ssh-termux` to push directly into a remote mpv socket —
still works for small setups (and now writes archives to the same
`~/.local/state/agent-audio-relay/` location so `tts-ctl` resolves
session-scoped replay identically). Skip it if you also want the
multi-channel ducking that requires mpv-mcp on the player side.

## Watcher daemon (core)

The `agent-audio-relay` command watches directories for `*.play`
publish markers (see [Publish protocol](#publish-protocol-play-markers)
below) in any `tts-*` subdirectory, queues the corresponding audio
file (`mp3`/`opus`/`ogg`/`wav`), optionally pads 1s of silence (avoids
Edge TTS last-word clipping), and delivers it through the configured
playback backend. Back-to-back messages are sequenced — it waits for
current playback to finish before starting the next.

Hooks name their clips with a denote-style stem
(`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS--<host>--<session>__<persona>_<agent>_<kind>.<ext>`)
via the shared `hooks/lib/denote-stem.sh` helper, and the watcher
preserves the original stem end-to-end so backends can archive and
replay by identity. The `<host>` segment is the *producing* machine's
short hostname — encoded by the producer rather than re-derived at
archive time, so multi-host setups don't collide on `latest--<session>`
when two hosts happen to use the same tmux session name.

**Requirements:** `inotify-tools`, `ffmpeg` (for silence padding).

```sh
agent-audio-relay
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_BACKEND` | `ssh-termux` | Default selector — bare backend or `backend:target` |
| `RELAY_CONTROL_FILE` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agent-audio-relay/backend` (fallback `/tmp/agent-audio-relay-backend-<uid>`) | Control file used by `switch` |
| `RELAY_PROFILES_FILE` | `~/.config/agent-audio-relay/profiles.json` | Alias map |
| `RELAY_WATCH_DIRS` | `~/.cache/agent-audio-relay` | Colon-separated dirs to watch |
| `RELAY_QUEUE_DIR` | `/tmp/agent-audio-relay-queue` | Local queue directory (set to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/agent-audio-relay-queue` under systemd to avoid cross-user `/tmp` collisions — see the shipped unit) |
| `RELAY_PAD_SILENCE` | `1` | Pad 1s silence onto audio (`1` or `0`) |

### Publish protocol (`.play` markers)

Drop dirs use an **opt-in publish marker**. An audio file is only
played if a `<audio>.play` sidecar exists alongside it. Producers
write the audio to its final path (atomic rename), then create the
empty marker:

```sh
mv "$staging" /tmp/tts-claude/foo.mp3
: > /tmp/tts-claude/foo.mp3.play   # publish
```

The forwarder and watcher inotify on `*.play` only. Files dropped
without a marker (e.g. `tts-stream`'s concatenated archive that
already streamed live on the voice channel) coexist in the watch dir
without re-triggering playback. Consumers `unlink` the marker after
handling, and they drain any pre-existing markers at startup so a
restart doesn't lose events that fired during downtime.

If you write a custom producer:
- Put audio at its final path before creating the marker — consumers
  resolve the audio by stripping `.play` from the marker name.
- Use a real write (`: > marker` or `scp`/`cp` of an empty file). On
  Termux/Android, `touch` uses `utimensat()` and silently fails to
  fire `IN_CLOSE_WRITE`, so it doesn't work as a publish signal.
- Don't drop unrelated files into a watched dir without a marker if
  you don't want them played.

### Switching targets on the fly

The daemon resolves its selector per audio file, so you can change
backend or output target from another shell without restarting:

```sh
agent-audio-relay switch mpv                         # whole-backend switch
agent-audio-relay switch ssh-termux:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF # backend + target
agent-audio-relay switch headphones                  # alias from profiles.json
agent-audio-relay status                             # shows the active selector
agent-audio-relay list                               # prints backends + aliases
```

A selector has the form `<backend>[:<target>]` where `<target>` is
backend-specific — a BT MAC address for `ssh-termux` (requires
`RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD` to actually reroute; see below), or a PipeWire
sink name for `mpv` (mapped to `--audio-device=pulse/<target>`).

### Aliases (`profiles.json`)

Define friendly names for selectors in
`~/.config/agent-audio-relay/profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "headphones": { "backend": "ssh-termux", "target": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" },
    "car":        { "backend": "ssh-termux", "target": "11:22:33:44:55:66" },
    "speaker":    { "backend": "mpv",        "target": "bluez_sink.XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX.a2dp_sink" },
    "local":      { "backend": "mpv" },
    "phone":      { "backend": "ssh-termux" }
  }
}
```

See `examples/profiles.json` for a starter.

## Playback backends

### ssh-termux

Delivers audio to a remote device via SCP + `termux-media-player`. The
original backend — designed for Android phones running Termux over SSH.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_SSH_HOST` | `p8ar` | SSH alias for the target device |
| `RELAY_SSH_MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | Retry count for SCP/play |
| `RELAY_SSH_PLAYBACK_WAIT` | `120` | Max seconds to wait for playback |
| `RELAY_TERMUX_PLAYER` | `termux-media-player` | `mpv-ipc` to deliver via the long-running mpv-tts daemon (required if you want `tts-ctl`/popup controls to actually control delivery audio) |
| `RELAY_TERMUX_MPV_SOCK` | `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp/mpv-tts.sock` | Remote mpv IPC socket path |
| `RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD` | *(empty)* | Remote command run before playing when the target changes — the target is appended as a shell-quoted arg. Unset means no reroute. |

#### Bluetooth target switching

Android doesn't expose a stable API for picking the active A2DP device
from Termux, so the relay delegates the actual routing to a user-supplied
command. Set `RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD` to a shell invocation on the phone
that, when passed a target identifier as its last argument, makes that
device the active media sink. The target string is opaque to the relay —
it can be a MAC address, a Tasker task name, whatever your switch script
understands.

Rough examples (pick what fits your phone):

```sh
# Rooted phone — cmd bluetooth_manager connect to a MAC
export RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD='su -c "cmd bluetooth_manager connect"'

# Tasker (AutoRemote / EventGhost-style) — fire an intent per target
export RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD='am broadcast -a net.dinglisch.android.tasker.ACTION_TASK -e task_name BTSwitch --es par1'

# Your own wrapper on the phone
export RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD='~/bin/bt-switch'
```

`switch` logs `BT:SWITCH <target>` on success, `BT:FAIL …` on a non-zero
exit, and `BT:SKIPPED (no RELAY_TERMUX_SWITCH_CMD configured)` when a
target was selected but no command is set — in which case playback still
goes to whichever device Android currently considers active.

Clips are archived on the phone under
`~/.local/state/agent-audio-relay/<stem>.<ext>` (same location the `mpv`
backend uses, so `tts-ctl` reads one canonical archive regardless of
which backend produced the clip). Per-clip symlinks:

- `latest.<ext>` — global most-recent
- `latest--<host>--<session>.<ext>` — most-recent from a given host+session
- `latest--<session>.<ext>` — most-recent from a given session (any host)
- `latest--<session>__<agent>.<ext>` — session + agent scoped

`bin/tts-ctl` uses those symlinks to implement session-aware replay,
preferring the host-prefixed pointer first so cross-host session-name
collisions don't pick up another machine's clip.

#### SSH setup for Termux

The ssh-termux backend requires passwordless SSH access to an Android
device running [Termux](https://termux.dev/) with
[Termux:API](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API) installed. Here's
the setup from scratch.

**On the phone (Termux):**

```sh
# Install the SSH server and media player
pkg install openssh termux-api

# Start sshd (listens on port 8022 by default)
sshd

# Check your username — Termux uses a non-standard one
whoami
# Typically: u0_a317 or similar
```

**On the host (your server):**

```sh
# Copy your SSH key to the phone
# Replace <phone-ip> and <termux-user> with your values
ssh-copy-id -p 8022 <termux-user>@<phone-ip>

# Verify passwordless login works
ssh -p 8022 <termux-user>@<phone-ip> echo ok
```

**Create an SSH alias** in `~/.ssh/config` so the relay can connect by
name:

```sshconfig
Host phone
  HostName <phone-ip>
  Port 8022
  User <termux-user>
```

Then test end-to-end:

```sh
# Verify termux-media-player works
ssh phone termux-media-player info

# Set the relay to use your alias
export RELAY_SSH_HOST=phone
```

**Recommended: ControlMaster** for low-latency repeated connections.
Without it, every SCP + play cycle opens two new SSH connections. With
it, subsequent connections reuse the first one:

```sshconfig
Host phone
  HostName <phone-ip>
  Port 8022
  User <termux-user>
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
  ControlPersist 600
```

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.ssh/sockets
```

**Tailscale** works well if the phone and server are on different
networks. The phone's Tailscale IP is stable, so the SSH alias doesn't
break when you move between Wi-Fi and mobile data.

**Troubleshooting:**

- `PLAY:FAILED (ssh)` — check `ssh phone echo ok` works non-interactively
- `PLAY:FAILED (scp)` — check disk space on the phone (`df -h` in Termux)
- Audio plays but is silent — check phone volume; `termux-volume` can help
- `termux-media-player: command not found` — install `termux-api` package
  *and* the Termux:API Android app from F-Droid

### mpv

Plays audio locally via mpv. Supports direct invocation (spawns mpv per
file) or IPC mode (sends commands to a running mpv instance via its JSON
IPC socket). IPC mode is useful for gapless sequencing or routing audio
to a specific output device.

```sh
# Direct mode
RELAY_BACKEND=mpv agent-audio-relay

# IPC mode — start mpv with a socket first:
mpv --idle --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpv-relay.sock --audio-device=pulse/your-sink
# Then point the relay at it:
RELAY_BACKEND=mpv RELAY_MPV_SOCKET=/tmp/mpv-relay.sock agent-audio-relay
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RELAY_MPV_BIN` | `mpv` | Path to mpv binary |
| `RELAY_MPV_SOCKET` | *(empty)* | IPC socket path (enables IPC mode) |
| `RELAY_MPV_ARGS` | *(empty)* | Extra mpv arguments (space-separated) |
| `RELAY_MPV_WAIT` | `1` | Wait for playback to finish (`1` or `0`) |

## Output hooks

These generate TTS audio from agent responses and drop files where the
watcher picks them up. Each hook is tailored to a specific agent's
interface.

### Claude Code

Shell script registered as a Claude Code Stop hook. Extracts the last
assistant message from the conversation transcript, strips markdown,
generates Edge TTS audio.

```sh
cp hooks/claude-code-tts-hook.sh ~/.claude/claude-tts-hook.sh
chmod +x ~/.claude/claude-tts-hook.sh
```

Register in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/claude-tts-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_TTS_ENABLED` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable |
| `CLAUDE_TTS_ENGINE` | `edge` | TTS engine — `edge` (Microsoft Edge TTS, free) or `openai` (OpenAI TTS, paid, better voices) |
| `CLAUDE_TTS_VOICE` | `en-US-AriaNeural` (edge) / `marin` (openai) | Voice name. Edge uses names like `en-US-AriaNeural`, `en-AU-NatashaNeural`; OpenAI uses `alloy`, `marin`, `sage`, `nova`, etc. |
| `CLAUDE_TTS_DROP_DIR` | `/tmp/tts-claude` | Audio drop directory |
| `CLAUDE_TTS_OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` | OpenAI TTS model (only used when engine=`openai`) |
| `CLAUDE_TTS_OPENAI_PYTHON` | `python3` | Python interpreter with the `openai` package installed (only used when engine=`openai`) |

When `CLAUDE_TTS_ENGINE=openai`, the hook needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` in its
environment (set it via the `env` block on the hook entry in
`~/.claude/settings.json`, or globally in your shell).

### Codex

Shell script for the OpenAI Codex CLI. Codex pipes assistant response
text into the hook on stdin.

```sh
cp hooks/codex-tts-hook.sh ~/.codex/codex-tts-hook.sh
chmod +x ~/.codex/codex-tts-hook.sh
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CODEX_TTS_ENABLED` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable |
| `CODEX_TTS_VOICE` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Edge TTS voice |
| `CODEX_TTS_DROP_DIR` | `/tmp/tts-codex` | Audio drop directory |

### Pi (pi-coding-agent)

[`pi`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) is a TypeScript coding-agent
harness with a first-class extension API rather than a shell-hook config,
so the integration is shipped as a TS extension instead of a shell
script. It subscribes to the `agent_end` lifecycle event, extracts the
final assistant text from `event.messages`, strips markdown, runs TTS,
and drops the audio into a watched directory like the other hooks.
Uses `fetch` directly for OpenAI TTS and spawns `edge-tts` for the
optional Edge engine — no extra npm dependencies.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp extensions/pi-tts-extension.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/agent-audio-relay-tts.ts
# Reload pi or start a new session.
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_TTS_ENABLED` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable |
| `PI_TTS_ENGINE` | `edge` | `openai` or `edge`; OpenAI falls back to Edge on failure |
| `PI_TTS_VOICE` | `marin` (openai) / `en-US-AriaNeural` (edge) | Voice name |
| `PI_TTS_OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini-tts` | OpenAI TTS model. Speech models use `/v1/audio/speech`; realtime models like `gpt-realtime-2` use the Realtime WebSocket API and emit WAV. |
| `PI_TTS_EDGE_BIN` | `edge-tts` | Path to `edge-tts` (engine=edge) |
| `PI_TTS_DROP_DIR` | `~/.cache/agent-audio-relay/tts-pi` | Audio drop directory |
| `PI_TTS_MAX_CHARS` | `4000` | Cap on text length sent to TTS |

When `PI_TTS_ENGINE=openai`, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment pi
is launched from.

#### Streaming variant (sibling extension)

For low-latency playback during long responses, install the streaming
extension instead. It listens for pi's per-token `message_update` events
and pipes the deltas into a `tts-stream` subprocess so audio starts
within ~2-3s of the first sentence completing instead of waiting for
the whole response.

```sh
cp extensions/pi-tts-stream-extension.ts \
   ~/.pi/agent/extensions/agent-audio-relay-tts-stream.ts
# Don't install both — pick streaming OR post-completion, not both.
```

Engine + voice config is inherited via tts-stream's own env vars
(`RELAY_TTS_ENGINE`, `RELAY_OPENAI_VOICE`, `RELAY_QWEN_VOICE`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, etc.) so there's no per-extension
duplication. Set `PI_TTS_STREAM_ENABLED=0` to disable.

### OpenCode

Long-running watcher that polls OpenCode sessions for new `final_answer`
messages. Run as a systemd service alongside the main watcher.

```sh
cp systemd/opencode-tts-watcher.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
# Edit ExecStart path, then:
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now opencode-tts-watcher
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_TTS_ENABLED` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable |
| `OPENCODE_TTS_VOICE` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Edge TTS voice |
| `OPENCODE_TTS_DROP_DIR` | `/tmp/tts-opencode` | Audio drop directory |
| `OPENCODE_TTS_POLL_INTERVAL` | `3` | Seconds between polls |
| `OPENCODE_TTS_MAX_MESSAGE_AGE` | `300` | Skip messages older than this |

### HA/openclaw (SSE bridge)

Listens to the Home Assistant SSE event stream for
`openclaw_message_received` events. Generates TTS from openclaw agent
responses delivered through HA.

```sh
HA_TOKEN="your-long-lived-token" hooks/ha-tts-bridge.sh
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HA_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8123` | Home Assistant URL |
| `HA_TOKEN` | *(required)* | Long-lived access token |
| `TTS_VOICE` | `en-GB-SoniaNeural` | Edge TTS voice |

## Input sources

Input sources capture your voice, transcribe it, and route the text to
a coding agent. Currently the only implemented input source is Home
Assistant Assist — see [tmux-voice-bridge](https://github.com/davidj4tech/tmux-voice-bridge)
for that piece.

Future input sources could include local Whisper + a push-to-talk daemon,
Bluetooth earbud button detection, or a web-based interface — replacing
the HA dependency for voice input with something lighter.

## systemd setup

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user

# Make sure user services keep running after logout / across reboots
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

**Playback host (single-host or two-host setups).** The relay daemon:

```sh
cp systemd/agent-audio-relay.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
# Edit RELAY_BACKEND, RELAY_WATCH_DIRS, and backend-specific vars as needed.
# Default in the template is RELAY_BACKEND=mpv watching ~/.cache/agent-audio-relay.
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user reenable --now agent-audio-relay
```

**Sender host (two-host setups only).** The forwarder, in place of a
local relay daemon — never both at once on the same flow:

```sh
ln -sf /path/to/agent-audio-relay/bin/agent-audio-relay-forwarder.sh \
    ~/.local/bin/agent-audio-relay-forwarder.sh
cp systemd/agent-audio-relay-forwarder.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
# Optional: edit RELAY_FWD_REMOTE / RELAY_FWD_REMOTE_BASE / RELAY_FWD_WATCH_ROOTS
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user reenable --now agent-audio-relay-forwarder
```

**mpv-tts ssh tunnel (recommended, on every host that uses tts-ctl /
tts-popup).** Persistent ssh unix-socket forward to the phone's mpv-tts
IPC. Without it, every popup redraw and every `tts-ctl` op forks a
fresh ssh process — ~700ms per round-trip over Tailscale and stalls
indefinitely when the phone is asleep. With it, the tunnel's ssh
keepalives keep Tailscale warm, IPC ops use a local socat call
(~110ms RTT), and tts-ctl auto-discovers the local socket without any
env-var setup:

```sh
cp systemd/aar-mpv-tunnel.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user reenable --now aar-mpv-tunnel
```

If the tunnel drops (phone deep sleep, Tailscale flap), the script
auto-reconnects after a short backoff and tts-ctl falls back to the
slower ssh-fork path during the gap. On the phone side, run
`termux-wake-lock` once in the Termux session that hosts mpv-tts so
the OS doesn't pause it during deep sleep.

**OpenCode watcher (optional, on whichever host runs OpenCode).** Hook
script only — does not need the relay binary installed:

```sh
cp systemd/opencode-tts-watcher.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
# Edit ExecStart to point at your hooks/ path
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user reenable --now opencode-tts-watcher
```

## Playback control

`bin/tts-ctl` talks JSON-IPC to a long-running mpv daemon (the Termux
service `mpv-tts`, exposing `$PREFIX/tmp/mpv-tts.sock`). On the phone
the script writes to the socket directly; from any other host it
tunnels over `ssh $CLAUDE_TTS_PHONE_HOST` (default `p8ar`).

```sh
tts-ctl pause            # pause current playback
tts-ctl resume           # resume
tts-ctl toggle           # cycle pause if the right clip is loaded;
                         #   reload the session's latest if it isn't
tts-ctl replay [session] # reload+play this session's latest clip
                         #   (no global fallback — session is honored)
tts-ctl prev|next [sess] # walk this session's archive by mtime
tts-ctl playlist-prev    # mpv playlist-prev (music/voice channels)
tts-ctl playlist-next    # mpv playlist-next
tts-ctl seek 5           # relative seek (negative = backwards)
tts-ctl seek-percent 50  # absolute-percent seek
tts-ctl start            # seek to 0 (replay current clip from start)
tts-ctl volume -5        # add to mpv volume
tts-ctl mute             # toggle mute
tts-ctl slower|faster    # speed × 0.91 / × 1.1
tts-ctl speed 1          # set speed
tts-ctl status           # state + position/duration + volume
tts-ctl nowplaying       # current file path
tts-ctl get PROP...      # one IPC round-trip; one line per property
```

**Channels.** mpv-mcp on the phone runs three independent mpv instances
— `mpv-tts` (agent voice, baseline volume 100), `mpv-voice`
(audiobooks/podcasts, baseline 85, paused while tts plays), and
`mpv-music` (background music, baseline 50). `tts-ctl` defaults to the
tts socket; pass `--socket PATH` (or set `AAR_MPV_SOCKET`) to drive
the music or voice channel instead. Archive-aware ops (`replay`,
`prev`, `next`, the session-pinned reload in `toggle`) are only
meaningful for tts — on music/voice they degrade to cycle-pause / no-op
since no archived clip will match.

**Mopidy music backend.** Set `AAR_MUSIC_BACKEND=mopidy` to make the
`music` channel in `tts-popup`, `tts-status-line`, and `tts-ctl --socket
.../mpv-music.sock` talk to Mopidy's MPD endpoint instead of mpv IPC.
Optional connection vars: `MOPIDY_MPD_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and
`MOPIDY_MPD_PORT` (default `6600`). tts/voice remain on mpv.

Required on the phone: `mpv`, `socat`, `jq`, and an mpv daemon launched
with `--input-ipc-server=$PREFIX/tmp/mpv-tts.sock --idle=yes`. Override
the socket with `AAR_MPV_SOCKET` if your daemon binds elsewhere
(legacy `MPV_TTS_SOCK` is still honored).

The companion project [mpv-mcp](https://github.com/davidj4tech/mpv-mcp)
(Node, runs in Termux) provisions both `mpv` channels as runit services,
exposes the same controls as an MCP server + HTTP/JSON API, and serves
an installable PWA at `http://<tailscale-ip>:8765/` with mpv-style
keyboard shortcuts. If you set `RELAY_TERMUX_PLAYER=mpv-ipc` on this
relay, that's the phone-side daemon you're talking to.

### Floating tmux popup

`bin/tts-popup` is an interactive single-key controller meant to run
inside `tmux display-popup -E`. Drop these bindings into
`~/.tmux.conf.local` (or `source-file` the shipped snippet at
`examples/tmux.conf.snippet`):

```tmux
bind T switch-client -T tts
bind -T tts t     display-popup -E -w 95% -h 7 "TTS_POPUP_SESSION='#{session_name}' ~/.local/bin/tts-popup"
bind -T tts Space display-popup -E -w 95% -h 3 "~/.local/bin/tts-ctl toggle '#{session_name}'"
bind -T tts r     display-popup -E -w 95% -h 3 "~/.local/bin/tts-ctl replay '#{session_name}'"
```

The `'#{session_name}'` argument pins replay/toggle to the invoking tmux
session. Without it, `display-popup -E` doesn't reliably propagate
`$TMUX_PANE`, and the popup would replay clips from whichever session
`tts-ctl` happened to resolve.

Hotkeys inside the interactive popup: `Space` reload-or-toggle (loads
this session's latest if a different clip is loaded; otherwise cycles
pause), `r` replay (or restart-current on music/voice), `0` seek to
start, `h`/`l` seek ±5s, `H`/`L` seek ±30s, `1`–`9` seek to N×10%,
`-`/`=` volume ±5, `m` mute toggle, `[`/`]` slower/faster, `<`/`>`
prev/next clip in this session's archive (or `playlist-prev`/`-next`
on music/voice), `i` clip info, `?` keymap, `q` (or `Esc`) close. The
popup auto-closes `TTS_POPUP_AUTO_CLOSE` seconds after playback ends
(default 10, set to 0 to disable). Width is given as a percentage so
the popup fits on narrow displays (Termux on a phone).

**Channel binding.** At startup the popup probes the three channel
sockets (tts, voice, music) and binds to whichever is currently
non-idle, in priority order tts > voice > music; falls back to tts
when all are idle. The label gets a `[v]`/`[m]` prefix on voice/music
so you can see at a glance which channel the popup is driving. tts
looks unchanged when only tts is in use. Override with
`AAR_MPV_SOCKET=/path/to/sock` to pin the popup to a specific channel.

### As a tmux plugin (TPM)

For users of [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), the repo ships
a `tts.tmux` entry point at the root that wires up the popup binding +
status-right integration in one go:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'davidj4tech/agent-audio-relay'
# Optional overrides — defaults shown:
# set -g @tts-prefix-key      T
# set -g @tts-popup-key       M-t       # no-prefix shortcut for the popup
# set -g @tts-toggle-key      M-Space   # no-prefix one-keystroke play/pause
# set -g @tts-popup-width     22
# set -g @tts-popup-height    3
# set -g @tts-popup-x         R
# set -g @tts-popup-y         0
# set -g @tts-status-line     on
# set -g @tts-status-interval 1
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```

You still need `pip install --user agent-audio-relay` (or equivalent)
on each host so `tts-ctl`, `tts-popup`, and `tts-status-line` are on
`$PATH` — the plugin only sets up the tmux side. If you'd rather not
use TPM, source `examples/tmux.conf.snippet` from your tmux config
instead.

### Without TPM (or with a `run`-based config loader)

TPM discovers `set -g @plugin '…'` lines by scanning files reachable
via `source-file` from your top-level `~/.tmux.conf`. If your config
loader uses `run` instead — gpakosz/oh-my-tmux's `.tmux.conf.local`
is the common case — TPM never sees the @plugin line in that file
and the plugin silently doesn't install. Symptom: `prefix T t` does
nothing because no binding was registered.

The package ships a `tts-tmux-install` entrypoint that bypasses TPM
and directly registers the same bindings + status-right integration.
Add **one line** to your tmux config (your `.tmux.conf.local` if you
use oh-my-tmux):

```tmux
run-shell "tts-tmux-install"
```

The same `@tts-*` overrides documented above (prefix-key, popup-key,
toggle-key, popup geometry, status-line, status-interval) work with
this path too — `tts-tmux-install` reads them via `tmux show -gqv`.

You still need `pip install --user agent-audio-relay` (or pipx) so
`tts-tmux-install`, `tts-ctl`, `tts-popup`, etc. are on `$PATH`.

### Status-line integration

For an always-on display that doesn't take a popup, add `tts-status-line`
to your tmux `status-right`. It prints a compact one-liner while a clip
is loaded and emits nothing when all channels are idle, so your normal
clock / date / battery / whatever shows through unchanged the rest of
the time. Like the popup it probes tts > voice > music and renders
whichever is non-idle, with a `[v]`/`[m]` prefix on the non-tts
channels.

```tmux
set -g status-interval 1
set -g status-right '#(tts-status-line) #[fg=default] %H:%M  %d-%b'
```

Output during playback looks like:

```
▶ 00:08 ████░░░░░░░░ 00:55  12:34  03-May
```

(adds `[M]` if mpv is muted; `⏸` if paused; nothing at all if idle).

Each invocation is one IPC round-trip via the `aar-mpv-tunnel` (~110ms
on Tailscale). For oh-my-tmux users who keep customisations in
`~/.tmux.conf.local`, append the snippet there rather than editing the
upstream `~/.tmux.conf`.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TTS_STATUS_BAR_WIDTH` | `12` | Width of the █░ progress bar |
| `TTS_STATUS_HIDE_IDLE` | `1` | Set `0` to show `○` instead of empty when idle |

## Streaming TTS for `llm` and friends (`tts-stream`)

The hooks for Claude Code / Codex / opencode all fire *post-completion*:
the agent finishes, the hook reads the final text, `tts-drop` generates
one mp3, the forwarder ships it. Latency-from-finish-to-audio is
dominated by edge/openai TTS render time (~1-2s for short text). Fine
for short notifications.

For a streaming model output (e.g. `llm "..."` producing a multi-paragraph
response), waiting for the whole thing to render before any audio plays
feels laggy. `tts-stream` is the streaming sibling of `tts-drop`:

```sh
llm "explain X" | tts-stream                              # text + audio
llm "..." | tee >(tts-stream >/dev/null)                  # tee form
llm "..." | tts-stream --no-tee >/dev/null                # silent (no echo)
```

Audio starts within ~3s of the first sentence completing instead of
waiting for the whole response. Sentence-boundary segmenter (with
abbreviation exceptions and a force-split fallback at ~240 chars), eager
first-segment split at the first `,;:` past 60 chars to minimise
time-to-first-audio, bounded parallel rendering (default 2 workers),
order-preserving dispatch. Skips fenced code blocks since reading them
produces noise.

### Architecture (sam-radio-style HTTP streaming)

`tts-stream` doesn't dispatch per-segment loadfiles to mpv (mpv-voice
is on the phone, the audio files are on the producer host — paths
don't resolve across the tunnel). Instead, each invocation:

1. Binds an HTTP server on a random local port for the run's lifetime.
2. Sends mpv-voice exactly one `loadfile http://<host>:<port>/stream.mp3`
   (preceded by `stop` to clear any prior playback state).
3. Pushes each rendered segment's MP3 bytes into the HTTP stream queue
   *in seq order* — concatenated MP3 frames produce a valid byte stream
   that mpv plays continuously. mpv's cache buffers ~1-2s and starts
   playing as soon as it fills.
4. On stdin EOF: signals end-of-stream, waits for the handler to flush
   to mpv, tears the server down.
5. Concatenates the per-segment files into one full-response clip and
   drops into `/tmp/tts-llm/`. Forwarder ships it through the normal
   pipeline so `tts-ctl replay` / `prev` / `next` walk **responses**,
   not segments.

The phone resolves the producer's hostname via Tailscale MagicDNS. If
that doesn't apply to your setup, set `AAR_STREAM_HOST=<reachable
host-or-ip>` so the URL we hand to mpv resolves phone-side.

### Engine and configuration

Defaults to **openai** (`gpt-4o-mini-tts`) when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
— noticeably more natural prosody for long-form spoken content — and
**edge** (`en-US-AriaNeural`) otherwise. `RELAY_TTS_ENGINE=edge|openai`
forces a choice. `tts-stream` auto-discovers an openai-capable Python
in the usual pipx venv locations (`~/.local/pipx/venvs/openai`, `…/llm`)
when the default `python3` lacks the `openai` module, so you don't
typically need to set `RELAY_OPENAI_PYTHON`.

```sh
tts-stream --engine openai                    # explicit
tts-stream --engine edge --voice en-GB-RyanNeural  # custom voice
tts-stream --max-workers 3                    # more in-flight renders
tts-stream --no-archive                       # skip the post-stream concat
tts-stream -v                                 # per-event timestamp logging
```

### Panic button

`tts-ctl stop-all` silences every channel (tts/voice/music) regardless
of which session originated playback, and pkills any in-flight
`tts-stream` producer processes so they don't keep generating into a
silent consumer. Useful when a streaming response from another session
is making noise and you just want it to stop.

### Caveats

- **First-sentence latency floor** is engine round-trip (~1-2s for
  openai, ~1s for edge). The eager-first-segment split keeps it from
  being worse, but you can't go below that without per-byte streaming
  of the engine response (deliberately not built; marginal win for
  significant complexity).
- **Eager-first-split** intentionally cuts at a comma rather than the
  end of the opening sentence — first segment may end mid-clause for
  prosody-perfect ears. Tradeoff for time-to-first-audio.
- **Prior-run leftover** would replay near the end of a new stream
  before we added the pre-loadfile `stop`. If it ever resurfaces,
  inspect `mpv-voice` log for fresh `● Audio` events or duration
  changes mid-playback.
- **Code blocks are silenced**. Anything between fenced ` ``` ` markers
  is stripped before TTS. Don't rely on `tts-stream` to read code.

## Adding a new agent hook

To add TTS for any new tool, write a script that:

1. Detects when the tool finishes responding
2. Extracts the response text
3. Sources `hooks/lib/denote-stem.sh` and names the clip via
   `make_stem <agent> <kind> [session_override]` so it carries
   session/persona identity end-to-end
4. Generates audio:
   `edge-tts --text "..." --write-media "/tmp/tts-<tool>/$(make_stem <tool> <kind>).mp3"`

The watcher picks up any supported audio file dropped into a `tts-*`
subdirectory under a watched path.

## Adding a new playback backend

Subclass `agent_audio_relay.backends.PlaybackBackend` and implement
`play(path)` and optionally `wait_for_playback()`. Register it in
`backends/registry.py`. See `ssh_termux.py` or `mpv.py` for examples.
