"""tts-stream — incremental TTS for streaming model output.

Reads text on stdin, segments it incrementally on sentence boundaries,
renders each segment to audio in parallel (bounded), and dispatches the
clips to mpv in order via the voice channel's IPC socket — so audio
starts playing within ~1-2s of the first sentence completing instead
of waiting for the whole response to finish.

After the stream ends, the per-segment files are concatenated into a
single full-response clip and handed to ``tts-drop`` to be archived
with normal latest-symlink semantics — so replay/prev/next still walk
*responses*, not segments. Per-segment files are ephemeral and live in
``/tmp/tts-stream/<run-id>/``.

Usage:
    llm "explain X" | tts-stream [--engine edge|openai] [--voice NAME]
                                 [--socket PATH] [--tag llm] [--session ID]
                                 [--no-archive] [--max-workers N]

Why a sibling to tts-drop instead of an extension of it: tts-drop's
abstraction is "one clip → archive → latest". Stream segments aren't
independently replayable units — forcing a `--no-latest` flag onto
tts-drop just pushes the concept where it doesn't belong, and segments
would still pay the drop-dir/forwarder/scp/relay cost when streaming
needs to go straight to the local mpv socket. tts-stream owns its own
pipeline; tts-drop runs *once* at the end with the concatenated blob.

# (Range-aware) so mpv can seek mid-stream. mpv handles cache, jitter,
# and codec framing — we don't.
#
# Why not per-segment loadfile-by-path: mpv-voice runs on the phone, the
# audio files exist on the producer host (homer/melr/sp4r). loadfile of a
# local path on the producer side resolves on the *phone's* filesystem
# where the file doesn't exist. HTTP fixes that without adding scp/sshfs.
#
# Why a buffer instead of a one-shot queue: mpv may make multiple
# concurrent GETs (probe + play, then more on every seek). A queue
# disperses bytes across whichever handler is reading at the moment;
# a shared buffer lets each handler tap in at the offset it cares about.
